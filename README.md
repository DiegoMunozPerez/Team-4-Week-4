# Lab 04 - SOP/POS and KMaps

In this lab, you’ve learned how to apply KMaps, Sum Of Products and Products of
sums to simplify digital logic equations. Then, you’ve proven out that they work
using an implemented design on your Basys3 boards.

## Lab Questions

### Why are the groups of 1’s (or 0’s) that we select in the KMap able to go across edges?

Because the K-Map can wrap around like a cylender, only one variable changes as it moves over one colum/row.

### Why are the names Sum of Products and Products of Sums?

Becuase SOP we take thhe sum of the outputs and multiply them, POS we multiply the outputs and add them.

### Open the test.v file – how are we able to check that the signals match using XOR?

When runnig simulation the singnals match because it is a XOR, so in a succesfull run if no errors occur then the signal match.
